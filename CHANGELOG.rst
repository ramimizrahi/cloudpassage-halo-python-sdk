v1.2.2 (2018-10-31)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Python 3.6.5 support. [Ash Wilson]


v1.2 (2018-10-28)
-----------------

New
~~~
- Python 3.7 support. [Ash Wilson]

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Improved deduplication in TimeSeries class. [Ash Wilson]

  Expanded deduplication routine to compare against prior
  batch of objects from API. In some extremely rare circumstances,
  multiple different events with the exact same timestamp would slip
  through the deduplication routine `TimeSeries.remove_duplicate_items`.
  This patch improves deduplication while still using the object's
  timestamp as a cursor.

  Closes #142
- Improve documentation of Server() instance methods. [Ash Wilson]


v1.1.5 (2018-09-15)
-------------------

New
~~~
- Use connection pooling. [Ash Wilson]

  The SDK now uses connection pooling via the requests.Session() object. This
  brings performance benefits as the SDK will no longer need to open a new TLS
  connection for every interaction with the CloudPassage API.

  Connection pool minimum of 1, max of 10 concurrent connections in session.
  Closes #112

  Exponential backoff implemented via requests, 5 tries max.

  Retry happens in requests via HTTPAdapter for everything but re-auth, which is caught and retried in SDK.
  Closes #113

  Migrated CI testing environment.
  Closes #114

Changes
~~~~~~~
- Codeclimate coverage for master branch. [Ash Wilson]

  Closes #121
- Testing matrix includes Python2.7.10 and 2.7.15. [Ash Wilson]

  We can add more over time, as the need arises. Adding
  another version of Python adds around 12 minutes to total
  CI time per commit, and tests cannot be run in parallel.
  Closes #115
- Updated requests version pin to >=2.18. [Ash Wilson]

  Removed requirements.txt file, which was unnecessary. The
  setup.py file is used by easy_install to ensure dependencies
  are in place.
  Closes #118
